# Intel Image Classification
* Developed a neural network model using a CNN architecture for the classification of images into six different
categories in the Intel Image Classification Dataset (accuracy: 0.863, precision: 0.866, recall: 0.865).
* Implemented various layers in the neural network, including Convolutional (Conv2D) layers, MaxPooling2D layers
for downsampling, BatchNormalization layers for normalizing the input, Flatten layer to convert the 2D output into
a 1D vector
